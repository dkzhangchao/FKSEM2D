You may now try different incidence angles, such as 4, 12, 20, 28, 332, 340, 348, 356 degrees. The angles are in the domain of (0, 360). Previously, I put each computation in a separate folder, and named them as 

event1, event2, ..., event 8. 

Together with these event folders, I also have folder named combine, just gathering the results of each event. Please refer to the attached for the combine folder. 

You can follow the steps in workFlow to conduct the inversion. The scripts were old and quite tedious. You please optimize the procedure if you think it is necessary.
